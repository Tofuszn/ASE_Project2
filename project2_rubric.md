### FAQ

Q: For code link, what should I do?
A: You can give the link to your code in GitHub. For example, the first ASE 230 PHP server code can be found in <https://github.com/nkuase/ase230/tree/main/module1/code/1_First_PHP_Server>, you share the link similarly.

Q: Why do I need to check the zipped file size?
A: Some students copy all the GitHub files, not just code or document to make huge sized zip files. So, students need to check the zip file does not include any .git or similar hidden directories/files in it.

Q: Do I need to make two zipped files for code and document?
A: Yes, the code directory should contain the Laravel code and scripts (module 2), and the presentation directory should contain the GitHub.io files (module 3).
